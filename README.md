This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (ipynb) that demonstrates the use of algorithmic trading algorithms for equity investing.

The notebook includes code examples for implementing popular algorithmic trading strategies. These strategies are designed to help investors optimize their portfolio performance by analyzing historical price data and identifying patterns that can predict future market movements.

To use this notebook, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Once you have these libraries installed, you can simply open the ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the code cells in order to see how the different trading strategies are implemented and how they perform on historical data.

Please note that this notebook is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used as the sole basis for making investment decisions. Always do your own research and consult with a licensed financial advisor before investing any money in the stock market.
